# Crystal-system-classification-for-Lithium-ion-batteries

## INTRODUCTION
Lithium-ion batteries are commonly used for
portable electronics, electric vehicles, and aerospace
applications. During discharge, Lithium ions move
from the negative electrode through an electrolyte to
the positive electrode to create a voltage and current.
During recharging, the ions migrate back to the
negative electrode.
## PROBLEM STATEMENT
To perform EDA on the crystal system of Li-ion
battery and to classify the battery class as
monoclinic, orthorhombic and triclinic on the
basis of their crystal system.
## ABOUT THE DATASET
The dataset contains the physical and chemical
properties of the Li-ion silicate cathodes. These
properties are used to predict the class of a Li-ion
battery on the basis of their crystal system. This data
consist of 339 rows and 11 columns.
- Formula: chemical formula of the compound.
- Space group: symmetry group of a 3D crystal
pattern.
- Formation Energy : energy required to produce
material from standard elements.
- E Above Hull : energy released if compound is
decomposed to the most stable compounds.
- Band Gap : Larger band gap indicates that the
compound is worse at conducting electricity or
heat.
- Nsites : Number of atoms in the unit cell of the
crystal.
- Density : mass per volume of bulk crystalline
materials.
- Volume: unit cell volume of the material
- Band structure : Boolean variable for band
structure.
## CONCLUSION
- The crystal structure has a major effect on the
physical and chemical properties of Li-ion
batteries. These properties can be useful to
predict the class of a Li-ion battery.
- These batteries can be classified on the basis of
their crystal system. that include monoclinic,
orthorhombic and triclinic.
- Comparing the ML models, the Random forest
classifier has the highest accuracy and wins the
race among the other models. Thereby making
a better predictions and achieve better
performance.
